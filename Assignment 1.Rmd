When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

First, download and preprocess the data set to the current working directory if the data doesn't already exist.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
if (! file.exists('repdata-data-activity.zip')) {
    download.file('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip', './repdata-data-activity.zip')
}
if (! file.exists()) {
    
}
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
